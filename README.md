# Imaginary-Sites
A repo containing all of the imaginary sites I have made for experience.

The imaginary sites are just websites created for an imaginary business, product, location etc and are made to gain experience in both web design and development.


### Imaginary Coffee House (https://pjaerr.github.io/Imaginary-Sites/Coffee-House/)
Made as a way to gain practice with making something in Figma and then going on to implement it. Also the first project in which I have used Grunt and SASS.
